# Claude Instructions for Quoroom — Room Repo

> **This file is for reference only.** The canonical instructions live in the cloud repo's `CLAUDE.md` and apply to **both** the `room` and `cloud` repos.
> Always read `/Users/vasily/projects/cloud/CLAUDE.md` for the full, authoritative set of rules — they govern all work across both repositories.
